             <p>Our winter courses kicked off in January with our Winter Skills Weekender - despite the stormy conditions - we had plenty of snow and a challenging avalanche forecast to navigate. It was a great weekend with loads of learning for our clients. 
                By the end of the week - Storm Isha and Jocelyn were hitting the mountains full force, with trains and flights all cancelled, Edna stayed along and joined us for another day out as we started our next Winter Skills week. </p>

                <p>Windy conditions kept us in the valley on the first day and with the guys keen for a summit, we headed to Cairngorm to see if we could push through the winds. Arriving at the top the winds reached their peak and while it was only for a short period,
                 the windchill was incredibly cold on the skin.</p>

                    Every morning of the course we spend around 1 hour looking at forecasts and planning our route for the day. What are the wind speeds? Where is safe to walk away from avalanche-prone slopes and do we have any dangers on our journey? Planning is pretty important in winter and all of our clients did a great job absorbing all the information and putting it into practice during the course.</p>

                    <h2>February</h2>
                    <p>
                        February was a challenging month with warm temperatures and little if any snow towards the end. Whilst this may be tricky for a Winter Skills course, the snow put down in January was still firm and holding out allowing us to run plenty of days on snow.</p>
